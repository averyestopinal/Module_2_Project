Module 2 Project

This assignment studies the question: "Does material cooling time reduces the tensile strength of a material?" This question is very relevant to engineers who make be designing the manufacturing process for a part. Quicker cooling means faster producting and lower costs, but does this may reduce the strength of a material.

Hypothesis:
H0 --> Null hypothesis, cooling time does not affect the tensile strength of a part.
H1 --> Less cooling time reduces the tensile strength of a material.

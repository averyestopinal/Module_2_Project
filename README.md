Module 2 Project

This assignment studies the question: "Does annealing reduce bolt tensile strength by 25% or more?" This question is very relevant to engineers who make be designing the manufacturing process for a bolt. Quicker cooling means faster producting and lower costs, but does this may reduce the strength of a material.

Hypothesis:
H0 --> Null hypothesis, annealing does not reduce the tensile strenth of a part by 25% or more
H1 --> Annealing decreases tensile strenth by 25% or more.
